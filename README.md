# Current pipelines

This is a place to evaluate the current pipelines available for processing DNA/RNA data. This will help us decide if there is a pipeline currently available for our use, one we could adapt, or if we will need to create a pipeline from scratch

See the current status of pipelines for processing:

- [RNAseq data](RNAseq_pipelines.md)
- [Small RNAseq data](small_RNAseq_pipelines.md)
- [Nanopore data](nanopore_pipelines.md)

Note. I'm typically ignoring pipelines that:

- Are not open source (with exceptions)
- Haven't been updated in several years (>5 years)
- Don't have good supporting documentation
