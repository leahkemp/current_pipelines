## Overview

A summary of some of the RNA-seq data analysis tools by [Ruairi J MacKenzie, 2018](https://www.technologynetworks.com/genomics/articles/rna-seq-basics-applications-and-protocol-299461):

"Tools like Sailfish, RSEM and BitSeq12 will help you quantify your expression levels, whilst tools like MISO, which quantifies alternatively spliced genes, are available for more specialized analysis. There is a library of these tools out there, and reading reviews and roundups are your best way to find the right tool for your research."

- There also exists an R framework for comparing pipelines (see [here](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13059-020-02136-7))
- [This paper](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13059-020-02136-70) outlines a number of papers that compare single-cell RNA pipelines
- A [recent paper](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20188746) (2019) that describes the best practices in single-cell RNA-seq analysis
- A [recent paper](AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAqUwggKhBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKSMIICjgIBADCCAocGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMdbpTwGltlCc7WTjbAgEQgIICWEvhDFT) (2018) that describes a website that acts as a reference set/database of human long non-coding RNAs
- A [recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s12276-018-0071-8.pdf) (2018) that describes Single-cell RNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines
